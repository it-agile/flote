PREREQUISITE FOR DEVELOPING
===========================
To develop flote, you need the bundler gem. This usually means you have to install it with
   sudo gem install bundler
(sudo is needed on OSX with the ruby provided by Apple. In other cases - e.g. if you are on another platform or are using rvm you may omit sudo if you wish to install the gem just for the current user.)

After installing the bundler gem call
  bundle install
to install all needed gems

COMMON TASKS WHEN DEVELOPING
============================
Create a new gem of flote and install it just locally 
   gem build flote.gemspec && 
     sudo gem install flote-*.gem && 
     mv -f flote-*.gem deploy/

Create a new gem of flote and push it to RubyGems.org 
   build_gem.sh

Install the latest flote version from RubyGems.org
   sudo gem install flote
